# Ektos AI

Ektos AI is an innovative platform aimed at reducing biases in AI decision-making processes using a multi-layered machine learning framework and blockchain technology. The platform focuses on three main use cases: financial, healthcare, and human resources.


## Project Architecture

The Ektos AI platform consists of four main components: frontend, backend, machine learning, and blockchain. Here's an overview of how these components interact with each other:

- The frontend is built using React and TypeScript and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform.
- The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript and handles API requests, data processing, and communication with the machine learning and blockchain components.
- The machine learning component is implemented using Python and various libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn. It trains and evaluates models for each use case and integrates with the backend for data processing and bias identification.
- The blockchain component is implemented using Solidity and Ethereum and ensures the transparency and immutability of decision records.

## Features

- Multi-layered machine learning framework for bias identification and mitigation
- Integration with blockchain for transparent and auditable decision recording
- User-friendly web interface for interacting with the platform
- Supports financial, healthcare, and human resources use cases

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python
- Solidity
- Truffle
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jojomani/ektos-ai.git
2. Install the dependencies for the client and server:
   - cd ektos-ai
   - cd client && npm install
   - cd ../server && npm install
3. Install the Python dependencies for the machine learning component:
   - cd ../ml
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Compile and deploy the smart contract:
   - cd ../blockchain
   - truffle compile
   - truffle migrate

### Running the Application Locally

1. Start the backend server:
   - cd server
   - npm start
2. Start the frontend development server:
   - cd ../client
   - npm start
3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

### Testing

1. Run backend tests:
   - cd server
   - npm test
2. Run frontend tests:
   - cd ../client
   - npm test
3. Run smart contract tests:
   - cd ../blockchain
   - truffle test

## Usage Guidelines

[Provide step-by-step instructions on how to use the Ektos AI platform]

1. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
2. Select a use case (financial, healthcare, or human resources) from the dashboard.
3. Choose a dataset to analyze for biases.
4. Initiate the machine learning process to train the models and identify potential biases.
5. View the results and insights provided by the platform.
6. Explore the decision records stored on the blockchain for transparency and auditability.
