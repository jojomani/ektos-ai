# Ektos AI Machine Learning

This directory contains the machine learning code for the Ektos AI platform. The machine learning models are implemented using Python and various libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the machine learning scripts:
   - python financial_model.py python healthcare_model.py python hr_model.py
  
## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- `models/`: Contains the trained machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experimentation.
- `financial_model.py`: Script for training and evaluating the financial use case model.
- `healthcare_model.py`: Script for training and evaluating the healthcare use case model.
- `hr_model.py`: Script for training and evaluating the HR use case model.
